# Scripts Rules

## Script Conventions

- Use `ts-node` for TypeScript scripts
- Use `commander` for CLI argument parsing
- Log to console with appropriate levels
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch

## Data Processing

- Always preserve mint address case
- Use full mint addresses in all operations
- Validate inputs before processing
- Use transactions for batch operations

## Analysis Scripts

- Store results in appropriate databases
- Generate reports in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, HTML)
- Include timestamps and metadata

## Migration Scripts

- Idempotent operations where possible
- Backup before destructive operations
- Log progress for long-running scripts
