# Package Versioning Requirement

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: All Packages Must Be Versioned

**Every package in the monorepo MUST have a valid semantic version number.**

This is a **non-negotiable requirement** enforced by CI/CD and pre-commit hooks.

## Requirements

1. **All packages must have a `version` field** in `package.json`
   - ✅ Public packages
   - ✅ Private packages (`"private": true`)
   - ✅ Internal-only packages
   - ✅ Experimental packages
   - ❌ **No exceptions**

2. **Version format**: Must follow Semantic Versioning (Semver)
   - Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.0.0`, `2.1.3`)
   - ❌ No `0.0.0` - This indicates an unversioned package
   - ❌ No pre-release versions in committed code

3. **Version bump requirements**:
   - **Every code change** that affects a package MUST bump that package's version
   - **PATCH** (`x.y.Z`): Bug fixes, typo corrections, internal refactoring
   - **MINOR** (`x.Y.z`): New features, new exports, backward-compatible additions
   - **MAJOR** (`X.y.z`): Breaking changes, removed APIs, incompatible changes

4. **Exceptions** (no version bump needed):
   - Only documentation files changed (`*.md`, `docs/**`)
   - Only test files changed (`*.test.ts`, `tests/**`)
   - Only configuration files changed (`*.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`)

## Enforcement

- **Pre-commit hook**: Runs `pnpm verify:package-versions` and blocks commits if requirements not met
- **CI pipeline**: Fails build if any package is missing a version or has `0.0.0`
- **PR checks**: Blocks merge if changed packages don't have version bumps

## Verification

```bash
# Check all packages have versions
pnpm verify:package-versions
```

## Summary

**Remember:**
- ✅ Every package MUST have a version
- ✅ Every code change MUST bump the version
- ✅ Versions MUST follow semver format
- ✅ CI/CD enforces these requirements
- ❌ No exceptions, no `0.0.0`, no missing versions

**This is a matter of importance for code quality and maintainability.**
