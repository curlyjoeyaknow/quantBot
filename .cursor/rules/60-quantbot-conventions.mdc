# QuantBot conventions (global)

QuantBot is a **caller-centric backtesting lab**:
- quantify which callers are worth following
- learn optimal post-alert trade management (stops + exits) under explicit downside constraints
- produce reproducible results (truth → policy → optimize)

**No live trading package lives in this repo.**

## Mint address handling (hard rule)

⚠️ NEVER MODIFY MINT ADDRESSES
- no truncation, case changes, or string manipulation
- store/pass full 32–44 char addresses, preserve exact case
- truncate ONLY for display/logging, never for storage/API calls

## Time & units (hard rule)

- Domain logic uses **milliseconds** for timestamps/durations.
- Normalize upstream inputs at the boundary (adapters/apps):
  - `Candle.timestamp` seconds → convert to ms BEFORE domain/handlers.
- Commands must not contain JS `Date` objects.

## Determinism (hard rule)

Given identical `(command, ports stubs, clock, id generator, random source)`, outputs must match.

- no `Date.now()` outside ClockPort
- no `Math.random()` outside RandomPort
- no hidden globals/singletons inside domain/handlers

## Node + native deps (practical rule)

Native bindings (duckdb/sqlite/etc.) are brittle across Node versions:
- prefer Node LTS for dev/CI (pin in toolchain)
- don’t export native-binding modules from package index barrels
- use lazy initialization for native deps
- mock native deps in test setup for unit tests

## Worktrees (practical rule)

Don’t rely on a globally-installed `quantbot` command pointing at the right checkout.
Prefer workspace execution (`pnpm -C <root> exec -- ...`) or explicit `QUANTBOT_CLI` overrides.

## Testing pointer

Testing contracts (purity, replay, regression requirements) live in `40-testing-contracts.mdc`.
