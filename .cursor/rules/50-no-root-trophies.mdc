# Root cleanliness

## Do not create
No more root-level files like:
- `STATUS_*`, `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_*`, `SUCCESS_*`, `NEXT_STEPS_*`, `MIGRATION_*`, etc.

## Do instead
- add notes to `docs/status.md` (chronological)
- add decisions to `docs/architecture.md` (stable)
- create ADRs in `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md` for major choices

## Goal
The root directory should help a new contributor answer in 30 seconds:
- what are the apps?
- what are the packages?
- how do I run tests?
- where is architecture documented?
