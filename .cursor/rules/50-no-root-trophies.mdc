# Root cleanliness

## Do not create (root trophies)

No more root-level files like:

- `STATUS_*`, `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_*`, `SUCCESS_*`, `NEXT_STEPS_*`, `MIGRATION_*`, `*_SUMMARY.md`, `*_REPORT.md`

These are how drift grows legs.

## Root directory: allowed markdown files only

Only these markdown files are allowed in repo root:

- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `TODO.md` (if used)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (if used)

Everything else belongs in `docs/`.

## Do instead

- ongoing notes: `docs/status.md` (chronological)
- stable system overview: `docs/architecture.md` (stable)
- major decisions: `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md`
- testing notes (coverage, plans): `docs/testing/`
- setup guides: `docs/guides/`
- migrations: `docs/migrations/`
- reviews: `docs/reviews/`

## Goal

The root directory should help a new contributor answer in 30 seconds:

- what are the apps?
- what are the packages?
- how do I run tests?
- where is architecture documented?
