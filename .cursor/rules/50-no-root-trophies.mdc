# Root cleanliness

## Do not create (root trophies)

No more root-level files like:

- `STATUS_*`, `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_*`, `SUCCESS_*`, `NEXT_STEPS_*`, `MIGRATION_*`, `*_SUMMARY.md`, `*_REPORT.md`

These are how drift grows legs.

## Root directory: allowed files and directories

### Allowed markdown files

Only these markdown files are allowed in repo root:

- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `TODO.md` (if used)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (if used)

Everything else belongs in `docs/`.

### Required directories

The `data/` directory is **required** in the root and has special rules:

- **MUST be present** in the repo root
- **NEVER move or delete** the `data/` directory
- **ONLY copy and backup** - never relocate
- Contains critical runtime state and databases
- Excluded from git via `.gitignore`

This directory is the canonical location for:
- DuckDB databases (`*.duckdb`)
- ClickHouse data (if local)
- Runtime state files
- Ingestion artifacts
- Analysis outputs

## Do instead

- ongoing notes: `docs/status.md` (chronological)
- stable system overview: `docs/architecture.md` (stable)
- major decisions: `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md`
- testing notes (coverage, plans): `docs/testing/`
- setup guides: `docs/guides/`
- migrations: `docs/migrations/`
- reviews: `docs/reviews/`

## Goal

The root directory should help a new contributor answer in 30 seconds:

- what are the apps?
- what are the packages?
- how do I run tests?
- where is architecture documented?
