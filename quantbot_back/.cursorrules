Follow the project architecture rules in `.cursor/rules/*` strictly.

Non-negotiables:
- Handlers depend only on ports + domain.
- Adapters implement ports; apps wire adapters to handlers.
- Hot path is dependency-sterile.
- No runtime state inside the repo (no logs/data/.pids/backups).
- No root-level "status/trophy" files; use docs.

When uncertain, choose:
- clearer boundaries
- deterministic handlers
- explicit composition roots
- minimal dependencies in hot path
