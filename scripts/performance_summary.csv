=== FORWARD PROJECTION (2025-12-15 to 2026-12-15) ===,
Projected Weeks,52
Projected Trades,4481
Monte Carlo Simulations,10000
,
=== PROJECTION METHODOLOGY ===,
Method,Bootstrap Trade-Level Monte Carlo (Empirical Distribution)
Compounding,Yes (individual trade returns compound multiplicatively)
Data Source,Full Performance History - Individual Trade Outcomes
,
=== BOOTSTRAP MODEL PARAMETERS ===,
Total Weeks Sampled,17
Average Weekly Return,7.83%
Std Dev Weekly Return,6.76%
Weekly Return Trend,-0.7875% per week
Average Trades Per Week,86.18
Trade Frequency Trend,-3.59 trades/week change
,
=== BOOTSTRAP MODEL FEATURES ===,
Empirical Distribution,Samples directly from actual weekly returns (no parametric assumptions)
Preserves Correlation,Maintains actual correlation structure of trades within weeks
Week-End Compounding,Compounds only at the end of each week (not per trade)
Time-Varying Returns,Weekly returns may improve or degrade over time based on historical trend (70% trend effect)
Conservative Adjustments,Accounts for small sample size (17 weeks) with aggressive performance decay penalty (up to 70%)
Worst-Case Scenarios,25% chance of worse-than-historical weeks to account for unseen outcomes
Increased Variability,Adds 40% of historical std dev (increasing over time) for realistic variability
Mean Reversion,5% chance of significant negative corrections (mean reversion effects)
Uncertainty Escalation,Variability increases up to 50% more in later weeks (uncertainty compounds)
Outcome Capping,Returns capped at -15% to +25% per week (allows more negative than historical minimum)
No Distributional Assumptions,Uses actual weekly return distribution (not normal/parametric)
,
=== IMPORTANT CAVEATS ===,
Small Sample Size,Projection based on only 17 weeks of historical data - results may still be optimistic
All Positive Weeks,Historical sample contains only positive weekly returns - negative weeks not observed
Extrapolation Risk,Projecting 52 weeks forward from 17 weeks of data involves significant uncertainty
Conservative Model,Model includes aggressive conservative adjustments - actual results may vary significantly
