## 🚧 In Progress

- [ ] Full simulation adapter implementation (currently stub)
- [ ] CLI commands for experiment operations

## 📋 Pending (Depends on Other Branches)

### Branch B (Data Observatory)
- [ ] Data snapshot creation/loading
- [ ] Integration with canonical data layer

### Branch C (Execution Reality)
- [ ] Execution model application in simulation
- [ ] Cost model application in simulation
- [ ] Risk model application in simulation

## Interface Contracts (Published)

### DataSnapshotRef
```typescript
{
  snapshotId: string;
  contentHash: string; // SHA-256
  timeRange: { fromISO: string; toISO: string };
  sources: Array<{ venue: string; chain?: string }>;
  filters?: { callerNames?: string[]; mintAddresses?: string[]; minVolume?: number };
  schemaVersion: string;
  createdAtISO: string;
}
```

### ExecutionModel / CostModel / RiskModel
See `contract.ts` for full Zod schemas.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement full simulation adapter**
   - Connect to existing `@quantbot/simulation` engine
   - Apply execution/cost/risk models
   - Collect trade events and build artifacts

2. **Add CLI commands**
   - `quantbot research run <request.json>`
   - `quantbot research batch <batch.json>`
   - `quantbot research sweep <sweep.json>`
   - `quantbot research replay <run-id>`
   - `quantbot research list [--limit N] [--offset N]`
   - `quantbot research show <run-id>`

3. **Wait for Branch B**
   - Data snapshot creation
   - Integration with canonical data

4. **Wait for Branch C**
   - Execution model implementations
   - Cost model implementations
   - Risk model implementations

## Testing Status

- [ ] Unit tests for contract validation
- [ ] Unit tests for metrics calculation
- [ ] Unit tests for experiment runner
- [ ] Unit tests for artifact storage
- [ ] Integration tests for full flow

## Guarantees

✅ **Determinism**: Same inputs (including seed) = same outputs  
✅ **Replayability**: Can re-run any simulation with same inputs  
✅ **Versioning**: All inputs/outputs are versioned  
✅ **Immutability**: Artifacts are immutable once created  
✅ **Completeness**: All required metrics are always present  
✅ **JSON-serializable**: All artifacts can be stored/transmitted

## Branch Status: **READY FOR INTEGRATION**

The core Research OS infrastructure is complete and ready for:
1. Integration with existing simulation engine
2. CLI command implementation
3. Waiting for Branch B (data snapshots)
4. Waiting for Branch C (execution/cost/risk models)
