# Why Code Connect Failed

## The Issue

Code Connect **ONLY works on Organization and Enterprise Figma plans**.

Reference: https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/23920389749655-Code-Connect

## Your Current Plans

- ❌ **Starter Plan** (meme worldorder's team) - View access only
- ❌ **Professional Plan** (Hannah Reed's team) - Full access, but no Code Connect

## What Code Connect Requires

✅ **Organization Plan** OR ✅ **Enterprise Plan**
- With Full or Dev seat
- Code Connect Write scope in personal access tokens

## What We Accomplished Instead

✅ All 7 Figma designs implemented as functional React components
✅ Working on localhost:3000
✅ Full state management with React hooks
✅ Proper navigation between pages
✅ Form validation
✅ Mobile-responsive design

## Components Created

1. **Sign In** - Email/password with validation
2. **Register** - Account creation with validation
3. **Forgot Password** - Password recovery flow
4. **Setup Overview** - Shop name setup (Step 1/4)
5. **Add Product** - Product addition with image upload (Step 2/4)
6. **Shipping & Pricing** - Shipping configuration (Step 3/4)
7. **Review Summary** - Final review before launch (Step 4/4)
