# @quantbot/bot - Telegram Bot Package

**⚠️ This package is not part of the Golden Path.**

This package provides the Telegram bot interface for interactive command-driven trading simulations and monitoring.

## Status

- Functional but not actively developed for Golden Path
- Golden Path focuses on CLI-based analytics pipeline
- Bot may be useful for interactive exploration but is secondary

## Usage

See main README.md for bot commands and setup.

## Golden Path Alternative

For Golden Path workflows, use CLI scripts:
- `pnpm ingest:telegram` - Ingest Telegram exports
- `pnpm ingest:ohlcv` - Fetch OHLCV data
- `pnpm simulate:calls` - Run simulations
