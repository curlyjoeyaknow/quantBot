- **Path:** `data/caller_alerts.db`
- **Table:** `caller_alerts`
- **Records Inserted:** 129

## Data Quality

### Case Sensitivity
All Solana mint addresses preserve their original case exactly as they appeared in the messages. Examples:
- `GuhgaLx17yG56Xv6bb6C7Mun9a88RLc7zEEqp5oFpump`
- `BHV5SrPszkDksja75hKJR4TzuxrmXUptm8eQaPeDpump`
- `5uJgHXWfe4ZXgVokmLk1M4Aoyp6Er8ns4DMEo2jSS4TN`

### Timestamp Format
All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format, converted to UTC:
- Example: `2025-12-05T18:53:22.000Z`

### Deduplication
- **Bot Responses Filtered:** Phanes, Rick, and other automated bot responses
- **Duplicate Window:** Calls for the same token within 5 minutes are considered duplicates
- **2 Duplicates Removed:** 
  - `36Q5RuwiXbLx...` by davinch (3.0min after first)
  - `BxBmLazgUME6...` by TY/ACC NO INFO (0.0min after first)

## Usage

### Query Database
```sql
-- Get all brook7 calls
SELECT caller_name, token_address, alert_timestamp 
FROM caller_alerts 
ORDER BY alert_timestamp DESC;

-- Get calls by specific caller
SELECT * FROM caller_alerts 
WHERE caller_name = 'exy' 
ORDER BY alert_timestamp DESC;

-- Get recent calls (last 24 hours)
SELECT * FROM caller_alerts 
WHERE alert_timestamp >= datetime('now', '-1 day')
ORDER BY alert_timestamp DESC;
```

### Load CSV in Python
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load all calls
df = pd.read_csv('data/exports/csv/brook7_calls_newest.csv')

# Filter by caller
exy_calls = df[df['caller'] == 'exy']

# Sort by timestamp
df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
df_sorted = df.sort_values('timestamp', ascending=False)
```

## Notes

- Bot responses (Phanes [Gold], Rick) are automatically filtered to avoid counting the same call twice
- Each token address is deduplicated within a 5-minute window to account for multiple people calling the same token
- Original case of mint addresses is preserved for accurate on-chain lookups
- All timestamps are in UTC timezone
